Structure of the Walk object/class

Class RJsonwalksWalk

The changes made in Nov 23 converted this class so that it was more structured and fields are private rather
 than public.

The class handles a Walk Manager(WM) walk, event or well being walk
In addition it handles a Walks Editor(WE) walk.

The class consists of a number of sections
Admin - information that is system information rather than data about the actual walk/event
Basics - the general information about a 'walk', title, date etc.
Meeting, Start and Finish - these are all collections of Timelocation objects, RJsonwalksWalkTimelocation, the collection is handled 
  as an Items class. RJsonwalksWalkItems. This allows each section to have none, one or more of these items. 
  Typically a meeting has zero or one item but WE can have more.
  Start has one item.
Walks - this section has one or more walk objects, RJsonwalksWalkWalk, again handled by the item class. 
     Typically there is one walk for a WM walk, one or more for a WE walk.
     For a WM Event there is no walk but a dummy walk is created this national grade of 'Event'
Contacts - this is a collection of contacts handled by the items class.
Media - 
Flags - Handles any Transport, Facilies flags
